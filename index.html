          <p>
            Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and
            pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water
            or milk for a fluffier texture. Heat the pan: Place a non-stick
            frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil. Cook the
            omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs.
            Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface. Add
            fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are
            still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings
            over one half of the omelette. Fold and serve: As the omelette
            continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the
            fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a
            plate. Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
